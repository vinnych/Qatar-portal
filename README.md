## Key Design Decisions

### Strategic Identity
The platform is branded as an **Independent Digital Concierge**. All features related to automated news aggregation or career listings have been decommissioned to ensure maximum legal transparency and focus on core utility guides.

### Pure Utility Focus
- **No Dynamic Feeds**: Automated jobs and news feeds have been eliminated.
- **Static Guides**: Information is served as verified, high-quality static utility guides.
- **Privacy Core**: No user accounts or data tracking. The portal remains a transient tool for public data access.
